# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 1. Intuition about K-Nearest Neighbors
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet powerful supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. The core idea of KNN is to make predictions based on the k-nearest neighbors in the feature space. For classification, the algorithm assigns the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors to the input instance. For regression, the algorithm predicts the average value of the k-nearest neighbors. KNN is a non-parametric method, meaning it does not assume any underlying distribution for the data.

## 2. Application: Case study where we can apply K-Nearest Neighbors
**Case Study:** Predicting Iris Flower Species

In the field of botany, classifying iris flowers based on their species is a common task. We can use K-Nearest Neighbors to model the relationship between flower features (such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and the species of the iris flower. By fitting a KNN model to historical labeled data, we can classify new flowers based on their measurements.

## 3. Elaboration: Math and Statistics behind K-Nearest Neighbors
K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm operates by finding the distance between the input instance and all the training samples. The distance can be measured using various metrics, with Euclidean distance being the most common:

$$
d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}
$$

where:
- ${x}$ and ${y}$ are two instances in the feature space.
-  $n$ is the number of features.

For classification, the class with the highest frequency among the k-nearest neighbors is assigned to the input instance. For regression, the average value of the k-nearest neighbors is used as the prediction.

## 4. Python Code to perform K-Nearest Neighbors for the problem presented in the case study
The Python code for performing K-Nearest Neighbors on an iris flower classification dataset is provided in a separate file: [knn.py](./knn.py).

## 5. Insights summary
K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple and intuitive algorithm that can be effective for various classification and regression tasks. In the context of classifying iris flowers, the KNN model leverages the distances between flower measurements to determine the species.

In our case study, the KNN model provides a high level of accuracy and reliable performance metrics. The evaluation metrics provide insights into the model's performance, such as its ability to correctly classify the species of iris flowers. These metrics are crucial for understanding the effectiveness of the model in real-world applications where accurate classification is important for research and conservation efforts in botany.
