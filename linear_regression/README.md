# Linear Regression

## 1. Intuition: About Linear Regression
Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in data science and statistics. It models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The main idea is to find the line that best fits the data points, which can then be used to make predictions.

## 2. Application: Case study where we can apply Linear Regression
**Case Study:** Predicting House Prices

In the real estate market, predicting house prices is a crucial task. We can use Linear Regression to model the relationship between house prices and various features such as the number of bedrooms, size of the house (in square feet), location, and age of the property. By fitting a linear model to historical data, we can predict the price of a house based on its characteristics.

## 3. Elaboration: Math and Statistics behind Linear Regression
Linear Regression assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable \( $y$ \) and the independent variable(s) \( $X$ \) is linear. The model can be expressed as:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon \
$$

where:
- \( $y$ \) is the dependent variable.
- \( $x_1$, $x_2$, $\ldots$, $x_n$ \) are the independent variables.
- \( \$beta_0$ \) is the intercept.
- \( $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, $\ldots$, $\beta_n$ \) are the coefficients.
- \( $\epsilon$ \) is the error term.

The goal is to estimate the coefficients \( \$beta$ \) that minimize the sum of the squared errors (SSE) between the observed values and the values predicted by the linear model. This is achieved using the least squares method.

The equation for the coefficients in matrix form is:
$$
\[ \beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y \]
$$
where \( $X$ \) is the matrix of input features, \( $X^T$ \) is the transpose of \( $X$ \), and \( $y$ \) is the vector of observed values.

## 4. Python Code to perform Linear Regression for the problem presented in the case study
The Python code for performing Linear Regression on the house prices dataset is provided in a separate file: [linear_regression.py](./linear_regression.py).

## 5. Insights summary
Linear Regression is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the relationship between variables. In this case study about predicting house prices, it helps identify which features have the most significant impact on the price and how changes in these features influence the predicted price. The simplicity and interpretability of Linear Regression make it a valuable starting point for many regression problems.
