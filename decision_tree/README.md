# Decision Trees

## 1. Intuition about Decision Trees
Decision Trees are a popular and powerful algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. They work by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features. This process is repeated recursively, creating a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents a final prediction.

## 2. Application: Case study where we can apply Decision Trees
**Case Study:** Predicting Employee Attrition

In the context of human resources, predicting whether an employee will leave the company (attrition) is a valuable task. We can use Decision Trees to model the relationship between employee characteristics (such as age, job satisfaction, and years at the company) and their likelihood of leaving. By fitting a decision tree model to historical data, we can predict whether an employee is likely to leave based on their attributes.

## 3. Elaboration: Math and Statistics behind Decision Trees
Decision Trees make predictions by following a series of decision rules inferred from the data features. The process of building a decision tree involves selecting the best feature to split the data at each node. The quality of a split is often measured using metrics such as Gini impurity or information gain.

- **Gini impurity** is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly classified. It is calculated as:
  
 
  \$${Gini} = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2$$
 

  where \( $p_i$ \) is the probability of an element being classified into a particular class.

- **Information gain** is the reduction in entropy after a dataset is split on an attribute. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or uncertainty in the dataset and is given by:

 
  \$${Entropy} = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \log_2(p_i)$$
 

  Information gain for a split is calculated as the difference between the entropy of the original dataset and the weighted sum of the entropy of each subset resulting from the split.

The goal is to select the splits that result in the highest information gain or the lowest Gini impurity, leading to the most homogeneous subsets.

## 4. Python Code to perform Decision Trees for the problem presented in the case study
The Python code for performing Decision Trees on an employee attrition dataset is provided in a separate file: [decision_tree.py](./decision_tree.py).

## 5. Insights summary
Decision Trees are a versatile and intuitive tool for classification and regression. In the context of predicting employee attrition, they help identify the key factors contributing to employee turnover. From the generated decision tree model, we observe that features like job satisfaction, age, and years at the company play significant roles in predicting whether an employee will leave or stay.

The accuracy of the model, as shown in the evaluation metrics, indicates how well the model performs on unseen data. For instance, the confusion matrix and classification report provide detailed insights into the model's performance, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. This helps in understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses.

Moreover, the visual representation of the decision tree provides clear decision rules that can be easily interpreted. These rules can be valuable for HR departments to implement targeted interventions aimed at reducing attrition rates. For example, increasing job satisfaction or addressing issues for employees who have been with the company for a certain number of years could be effective strategies to retain employees.
